Q1 : If one data type value is assigned to ‘a’ variable and then a 
different data type value is assigned to ‘a’ again. Will it change 
the value. If Yes then Why?

Ans:  Yes, In Python data type of variable need not to be specified. 
According to Value assigned to the variable, python determines the data 
type and alocate the memory. So as soon as we re- assign the different 
data type value given, variable will store the new value.
